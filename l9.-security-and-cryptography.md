# L9. Security and Cryptography

## Entropy <a id="entropy"></a>

[Entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_%28information_theory%29) is a measure of randomness. This is useful, for example, when determining the strength of a password.

[XKCD comic](https://xkcd.com/936/) 

Entropy is measured in _bits_,  
the entropy is equal to `log_2(# of possibilities)`. 

A fair coin flip gives log\__2\(2\) = 1 bit of entropy.   
A dice roll \(of a 6-sided die\) has log\__2\(6\) = ~2.58 bits of entropy.

## Hash functions <a id="hash-functions"></a>

A [cryptographic hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) maps data of arbitrary size to a fixed size, and has some special properties. A rough specification of a hash function is as follows:

```text
hash(value: array<byte>) -> vector<byte, N>  (for some fixed N)
```

### example: SHA1

E.g. hash function: [SHA1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1), which is used in Git. It maps arbitrary-sized inputs to 160-bit outputs \(which can be represented as 40 hexadecimal characters\). 

`sha1sum` command:

```text
$ printf 'hello' | sha1sum
aaf4c61ddcc5e8a2dabede0f3b482cd9aea9434d
$ printf 'hello' | sha1sum
aaf4c61ddcc5e8a2dabede0f3b482cd9aea9434d
$ printf 'Hello' | sha1sum 
f7ff9e8b7bb2e09b70935a5d785e0cc5d9d0abf0
```

### Properties

hard-to-invert random-looking function 

* Deterministic: the same input always generates the same output.
* Non-invertible: it is hard to find an input `m` such that `hash(m) = h` for some desired output `h`.
* Target collision resistant: given an input `m_1`, it’s hard to find a different input `m_2` such that `hash(m_1) = hash(m_2)`.
* Collision resistant: it’s hard to find two differente inputs `m_1` and `m_2` such that same output`hash(m_1) = hash(m_2)` \(note that this is a strictly stronger property than target collision resistance\).

Note: SHA-1 is [no longer](https://shattered.io/) considered a strong cryptographic hash function. You might find this table of [lifetimes of cryptographic hash functions](https://valerieaurora.org/hash.html) interesting. 

### Applications

* **Git, for content-addressed storage.** SHA1 The idea of a [hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function) is a more general concept \(there are non-cryptographic hash functions\). Why does Git use a cryptographic hash function?
* **A short summary of the contents of a file.** Software can often be downloaded from \(potentially less trustworthy\) mirrors, e.g. Linux ISOs, and it would be nice to not have to trust them. The official sites usually post hashes alongside the download links \(that point to third-party mirrors\), so that the hash can be checked after downloading a file.
* [Commitment schemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commitment_scheme). Suppose you want to commit to a particular value, but reveal the value itself later. For example, I want to do a fair coin toss “in my head”, without a trusted shared coin that two parties can see. I could choose a value `r = random()`, and then share `h = sha256(r)`. Then, you could call heads or tails \(we’ll agree that even `r` means heads, and odd `r` means tails\). After you call, I can reveal my value `r`, and you can confirm that I haven’t cheated by checking `sha256(r)` matches the hash I shared earlier.

### Ex

**Cryptographic hash functions.** Download a Debian image from a [mirror](https://www.debian.org/CD/http-ftp/) \(e.g. [from this Argentinean mirror](http://debian.xfree.com.ar/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/). Cross-check the hash \(e.g. using the `sha256sum` command\) with the hash retrieved from the official Debian site \(e.g. [this file](https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/SHA256SUMS) hosted at `debian.org`, if you’ve downloaded the linked file from the Argentinean mirror\).

## Key derivation functions <a id="key-derivation-functions"></a>

 [key derivation functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_derivation_function) \(KDFs\) are used for a number of applications, including producing fixed-length output for use as keys in other cryptographic algorithms. E.g. PBKDF2

-**slow**, in order to slow down offline brute-force attacks.

### Applications <a id="applications-1"></a>

* Producing keys from passphrases for use in other cryptographic algorithms \(e.g. symmetric cryptography, see below\).
* Storing login credentials. Storing plaintext passwords is bad; the right approach is to generate and store a random [salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_%28cryptography%29) `salt = random()` for each user, store `KDF(password + salt)`, and verify login attempts by re-computing the KDF given the entered password and the stored salt.

## Symmetric cryptography <a id="symmetric-cryptography"></a>

```text
keygen() -> key  (this function is randomized)

encrypt(plaintext: array<byte>, key) -> array<byte>  (the ciphertext)
decrypt(ciphertext: array<byte>, key) -> array<byte>  (the plaintext)
```

-property:  
--given the output \(ciphertext\), it’s hard to determine the input \(plaintext\) without the key.   
--`decrypt(encrypt(m, k), k) = m`.



what if lose the key? use KDF function to produce key from passphrase:  
passphrase --&gt;\[KDF\] --&gt; key

### Applications <a id="applications-2"></a>

* Encrypting files for storage in an untrusted cloud service.  This can be combined with KDFs, so you can encrypt a file with a passphrase before upload to the cloud.  Generate `key = KDF(passphrase)`, and then store `encrypt(file, key)`.

### Example

 AES256: has 256 bits in the key.

 Encrypt a file with AES encryption, using [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/): `openssl aes-256-cbc -salt -in {input filename} -out {output filename}`. Look at the contents using `cat` or `hexdump`. Decrypt it with `openssl aes-256-cbc -d -in {input filename} -out {output filename}` and confirm that the contents match the original using `cmp`.-&gt; echo $? -&gt; return 0

salt value: hash\(pwd+salt\) instead of hash\(pwd\)

## Asymmetric cryptography <a id="asymmetric-cryptography"></a>

```text
keygen() -> (public key, private key)  (this function is randomized)

encrypt(plaintext: array<byte>, public key) -> array<byte>  (the ciphertext)
decrypt(ciphertext: array<byte>, private key) -> array<byte>  (the plaintext)

sign(message: array<byte>, private key) -> array<byte>  (the signature)
verify(message: array<byte>, signature: array<byte>, public key) -> bool  (whether or not the signature is valid)
```

 

### Applications <a id="applications-3"></a>

* [PGP email encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy). People can have their public keys posted online \(e.g. in a PGP keyserver, or on [Keybase](https://keybase.io/)\). Anyone can send them encrypted email.
* Private messaging. Apps like [Signal](https://signal.org/) and [Keybase](https://keybase.io/) use asymmetric keys to establish private communication channels.
* Signing software. **Git** can have GPG-signed commits and tags. With a posted public key, anyone can verify the authenticity of downloaded software.

### Key distribution <a id="key-distribution"></a>

How to make sure the public key is real or fake?

Signal has one simple solution: trust on first use, and support out-of-band public key exchange \(you verify your friends’ “safety numbers” in person\).   
PGP has a different solution, which is [web of trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust).   
Keybase has yet another solution of [social proof](https://keybase.io/blog/chat-apps-softer-than-tofu) \(along with other neat ideas\). Each model has its merits; we \(the instructors\) like Keybase’s model.

## Case studies <a id="case-studies"></a>

### Password managers <a id="password-managers"></a>

This is an essential tool that everyone should try to use \(e.g. [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/), [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/), and [1Password](https://1password.com/)\).   
Password managers make it convenient to use unique, randomly generated high-entropy passwords for all your logins, and they save all your passwords in one place, encrypted with a symmetric cipher with a key produced from a passphrase using a KDF.

### Two-factor authentication <a id="two-factor-authentication"></a>

[Two-factor authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication) \(2FA\) requires you to use a passphrase \(“something you know”\) along with a 2FA authenticator \(like a [YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com/), “something you have”\) in order to protect against stolen passwords and [phishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing) attacks.

### Full disk encryption <a id="full-disk-encryption"></a>

Keeping your laptop’s entire disk encrypted is an easy way to protect your data in the case that your laptop is stolen. You can use [cryptsetup + LUKS](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_a_non-root_file_system) on Linux, [BitLocker](https://fossbytes.com/enable-full-disk-encryption-windows-10/) on Windows, or [FileVault](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204837) on macOS. This encrypts the entire disk with a symmetric cipher, with a key protected by a passphrase.

### Private messaging <a id="private-messaging"></a>

Use [Signal](https://signal.org/) or [Keybase](https://keybase.io/). End-to-end security is bootstrapped from asymmetric-key encryption. Obtaining your contacts’ public keys is the critical step here. If you want good security, you need to authenticate public keys out-of-band \(with Signal or Keybase\), or trust social proofs \(with Keybase\).

### SSH <a id="ssh"></a>

We’ve covered the use of SSH and SSH keys in an [earlier lecture](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/command-line/#remote-machines). Let’s look at the cryptography aspects of this.

When you run `ssh-keygen`, it generates an asymmetric keypair, `public_key, private_key`. This is generated randomly, using entropy provided by the operating system \(collected from hardware events, etc.\). The public key is stored as-is \(it’s public, so keeping it a secret is not important\), but at rest, the private key should be encrypted on disk. The `ssh-keygen` program prompts the user for a passphrase, and this is fed through a key derivation function to produce a key, which is then used to encrypt the private key with a symmetric cipher.

In use, once the server knows the client’s public key \(stored in the `.ssh/authorized_keys` file\), a connecting client can prove its identity using asymmetric signatures. This is done through [challenge-response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenge%E2%80%93response_authentication). At a high level, the server picks a random number and sends it to the client. The client then signs this message and sends the signature back to the server, which checks the signature against the public key on record. This effectively proves that the client is in possession of the private key corresponding to the public key that’s in the server’s `.ssh/authorized_keys` file, so the server can allow the client to log in.

### Ex

**Asymmetric cryptography.**

1. Set up [SSH keys](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys--2) on a computer you have access to \(not Athena, because Kerberos interacts weirdly with SSH keys\). Rather than using RSA keys as in the linked tutorial, use more secure [ED25519 keys](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SSH_keys#Ed25519). Make sure your private key is encrypted with a passphrase, so it is protected at rest.
2. [Set up GPG](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-gpg-to-encrypt-and-sign-messages)
3. Send Anish an encrypted email \([public key](https://keybase.io/anish)\).
4. Sign a Git commit with `git commit -S` or create a signed Git tag with `git tag -s`. Verify the signature on the commit with `git show --show-signature` or on the tag with `git tag -v`.
