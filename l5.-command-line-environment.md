# L5. Command-line Environment

## Job Control

&gt;&gt; man signal

You can learn more about these and other signals [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_%28IPC%29) or typing [`man signal`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/signal.7.html) or `kill -t`.

`Ctrl-C` and the command will stop.

### Killing a process <a id="killing-a-process"></a>

In our case, when typing `Ctrl-C` this prompts the shell to deliver a `SIGINT` signal to the process.

To kill this program we can now use the `SIGQUIT` signal instead, by typing `Ctrl-\`.

While `SIGINT` and `SIGQUIT` are both usually associated with terminal related requests, a more generic signal for asking a process to exit gracefully is the `SIGTERM` signal. To send this signal we can use the [`kill`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/kill.1.html) command, with the syntax `kill -TERM <PID>`.

### Pausing and backgrounding processes <a id="pausing-and-backgrounding-processes"></a>

 `Ctrl-Z` will prompt the shell to send a `SIGTSTP` signal, short for Terminal Stop \(i.e. the terminal’s version of `SIGSTOP`\).

We can then continue the paused job in the foreground or in the background using [`fg`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/fg.1p.html) or [`bg`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/bg.1p.html), respectively.

### kill processes

`SIGKILL` since it cannot be captured by the process and it will always terminate it immediately. However, it can have bad side effects such as leaving orphaned children processes.

### jobs

The [`jobs`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/jobs.1p.html) command lists the unfinished jobs associated with the current terminal session. You can refer to those jobs using their pid \(you can use [`pgrep`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pgrep.1.html) to find that out\). More intuitively, you can also refer to a process using the percent symbol followed by its job number \(displayed by `jobs`\). To refer to the last backgrounded job you can use the `$!` special parameter.

`&` -run the command in the background

backgrounded processes are still children processes of your terminal and will die if you close the terminal.

To prevent that from happening you can run the program with [`nohup`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/nohup.1.html) \(a wrapper to ignore `SIGHUP`\), or use `disown` if the process has already been started. 

```bash
$ sleep 1000
^Z
[1]  + 18653 suspended  sleep 1000

$ nohup sleep 2000 &
[2] 18745
appending output to nohup.out

$ jobs
[1]  + suspended  sleep 1000
[2]  - running    nohup sleep 2000

$ bg %1
[1]  - 18653 continued  sleep 1000

$ jobs
[1]  - running    sleep 1000
[2]  + running    nohup sleep 2000

$ kill -STOP %1
[1]  + 18653 suspended (signal)  sleep 1000

$ jobs
[1]  + suspended (signal)  sleep 1000
[2]  - running    nohup sleep 2000

$ kill -SIGHUP %1 (kill -HUP %1)
[1]  + 18653 hangup     sleep 1000

$ jobs
[2]  + running    nohup sleep 2000

$ kill -SIGHUP %2

$ jobs
[2]  + running    nohup sleep 2000

$ kill %2 (kill -KILL %2)
[2]  + 18745 terminated  nohup sleep 2000

$ jobs
```

## Terminal Multiplexers <a id="terminal-multiplexers"></a>

### tmux

-sessions

  --windows

    ----panes

`tmux` expects you to know its keybindings, and they all have the form `<C-b> x` where that means \(1\) press `Ctrl+b`, \(2\) release `Ctrl+b`, and then \(3\) press `x`. `tmux` has the following hierarchy of objects:

* **Sessions** - a session is an independent workspace with one or more windows
  * `tmux` starts a new session.
  * `tmux new -s NAME` starts it with that name.
  * `tmux ls` lists the current sessions
  * Within `tmux` typing `<C-b> d` detaches the current session
  * `tmux a` attaches the last session. You can use `-t` flag to specify which
* **Windows** - Equivalent to tabs in editors or browsers, they are visually separate parts of the same session
  * `<C-b> c` Creates a new window. To close it you can just terminate the shells doing `<C-d>`
  * `<C-b> N` Go to the _N_ th window. Note they are numbered
  * `<C-b> p` Goes to the previous window
  * `<C-b> n` Goes to the next window
  * `<C-b> ,` Rename the current window
  * `<C-b> w` List current windows
* **Panes** - Like vim splits, panes let you have multiple shells in the same visual display.
  * `<C-b> "` Split the current pane horizontally
  * `<C-b> %` Split the current pane vertically
  * `<C-b> <direction>` Move to the pane in the specified _direction_. Direction here means arrow keys.
  * `<C-b> z` Toggle zoom for the current pane
  * `<C-b> [` Start scrollback. You can then press `<space>` to start a selection and `<enter>` to copy that selection.
  * `<C-b> <space>` Cycle through pane arrangements.

For further reading, [here](https://www.hamvocke.com/blog/a-quick-and-easy-guide-to-tmux/) is a quick tutorial on `tmux` and [this](http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_adv_termmux.php) has a more detailed explanation that covers the original `screen` command. You might also want to familiarize yourself with [`screen`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/screen.1.html), since it comes installed in most UNIX systems.  


## Aliases <a id="aliases"></a>

makes the long command shorter

```text
alias alias_name="command_to_alias arg1 arg2"
```

Note that there is no space around the equal sign `=`, because [`alias`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/alias.1p.html) is a shell command that takes a single argument.

```bash
# Make shorthands for common flags
alias ll="ls -lh"

# Save a lot of typing for common commands
alias gs="git status"
alias gc="git commit"
alias v="vim"

# Save you from mistyping
alias sl=ls

# Overwrite existing commands for better defaults
alias mv="mv -i"           # -i prompts before overwrite
alias mkdir="mkdir -p"     # -p make parent dirs as needed
alias df="df -h"           # -h prints human readable format

# Alias can be composed
alias la="ls -A"
alias lla="la -l"

# To ignore an alias run it prepended with \
\ls
# Or disable an alias altogether with unalias
unalias la

# To get an alias definition just call it with alias
alias ll
# Will print ll='ls -lh'
```

To make an alias persistent you need to include it in shell startup files, like `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`, which we are going to introduce in the next section.

## Dotfiles <a id="dotfiles"></a>

Many programs are configured using plain-text files known as _dotfiles_ \(because the file names begin with a `.`, e.g. `~/.vimrc`, so that they are hidden in the directory listing `ls` by default\).

{% embed url="https://blog.flowblok.id.au/2013-02/shell-startup-scripts.html" %}

Some other examples of tools that can be configured through dotfiles are:

* `bash` - `~/.bashrc`, `~/.bash_profile`
* `git` - `~/.gitconfig`
* `vim` - `~/.vimrc` and the `~/.vim` folder
* `ssh` - `~/.ssh/config`
* `tmux` - `~/.tmux.conf`

What should you put in your dotfiles? You can learn about your tool’s settings by reading online documentation or [man pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page). Another great way is to search the internet for blog posts about specific programs, where authors will tell you about their preferred customizations. Yet another way to learn about customizations is to look through other people’s dotfiles: you can find tons of [dotfiles repositories](https://github.com/search?o=desc&q=dotfiles&s=stars&type=Repositories) on Github — see the most popular one [here](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) \(we advise you not to blindly copy configurations though\). [Here](https://dotfiles.github.io/) is another good resource on the topic.

All of the class instructors have their dotfiles publicly accessible on GitHub: [Anish](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotfiles), [Jon](https://github.com/jonhoo/configs), [Jose](https://github.com/jjgo/dotfiles).

### Neatly -&gt; dotfiles <a id="portability"></a>

![](.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2021-02-25-at-15.51.41.png)

## Portability

If the configuration file supports it, use the equivalent of if-statements to apply machine specific customizations. For example, your shell could have something like:

```text
if [[ "$(uname)" == "Linux" ]]; then {do_something}; fi

# Check before using shell-specific features
if [[ "$SHELL" == "zsh" ]]; then {do_something}; fi

# You can also make it machine-specific
if [[ "$(hostname)" == "myServer" ]]; then {do_something}; fi
```



If the configuration file supports it, make use of includes. For example, a `~/.gitconfig` can have a setting:

```text
[include]
    path = ~/.gitconfig_local
```

And then on each machine, `~/.gitconfig_local` can contain machine-specific settings. You could even track these in a separate repository for machine-specific settings.

This idea is also useful if you want different programs to share some configurations. For instance, if you want both `bash` and `zsh` to share the same set of aliases you can write them under `.aliases` and have the following block in both:

```text
# Test if ~/.aliases exists and source it
if [ -f ~/.aliases ]; then
    source ~/.aliases
fi
```

## Remote Machines\(SSH\) <a id="remote-machines"></a>

Secure Shell \(SSH\)

To `ssh` into a server you execute a command as follows

```text
ssh foo@bar.mit.edu
```

Here we are trying to ssh as user `foo` in server `bar.mit.edu`. The server can be specified with a URL \(like `bar.mit.edu`\) or an IP \(something like `foobar@192.168.1.42`\). Later we will see that if we modify ssh config file you can access just using something like `ssh bar`.

### Executing commands <a id="executing-commands"></a>

An often overlooked feature of `ssh` is the ability to run commands directly. `ssh foobar@server ls` will execute `ls` in the home folder of foobar. It works with pipes, so `ssh foobar@server ls | grep PATTERN` will grep locally the remote output of `ls` and `ls | ssh foobar@server grep PATTERN` will grep remotely the local output of `ls`.

### SSH Keys <a id="ssh-keys"></a>

Key-based authentication exploits public-key cryptography to prove to the server that the client owns the secret private key without revealing the key. This way you do not need to reenter your password every time. Nevertheless, the private key \(often `~/.ssh/id_rsa` and more recently `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`\) is effectively your password, so treat it like so.

#### Key generation <a id="key-generation"></a>

To generate a pair you can run [`ssh-keygen`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ssh-keygen.1.html).

```text
ssh-keygen -o -a 100 -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

You should choose a passphrase, to avoid someone who gets hold of your private key to access authorized servers. Use [`ssh-agent`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ssh-agent.1.html) or [`gpg-agent`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/gpg-agent) so you do not have to type your passphrase every time.

If you have ever configured pushing to GitHub using SSH keys, then you have probably done the steps outlined [here](https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/) and have a valid key pair already. To check if you have a passphrase and validate it you can run `ssh-keygen -y -f /path/to/key`.  


#### Key based authentication <a id="key-based-authentication"></a>

`ssh` will look into `.ssh/authorized_keys` to determine which clients it should let in. To copy a public key over you can use:

```text
cat .ssh/id_ed25519.pub | ssh foobar@remote 'cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'
```

A simpler solution can be achieved with `ssh-copy-id` where available:

```text
ssh-copy-id -i .ssh/id_ed25519.pub foobar@remote
```



### Copying files over SSH <a id="copying-files-over-ssh"></a>

There are many ways to copy files over ssh:

* `ssh+tee`, the simplest is to use `ssh` command execution and STDIN input by doing `cat localfile | ssh remote_server tee serverfile`. Recall that [`tee`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tee.1.html) writes the output from STDIN into a file.



* [`scp`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/scp.1.html) when copying large amounts of files/directories, the secure copy `scp` command is more convenient since it can easily recurse over paths. The syntax is `scp path/to/local_file remote_host:path/to/remote_file`

\`\`

* [`rsync`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/rsync.1.html) better if copy many files. improves upon `scp` by detecting identical files in local and remote, and preventing copying them again. It also provides more fine grained control over symlinks, permissions and has extra features like the `--partial` flag that can resume from a previously interrupted copy. `rsync` has a similar syntax to `scp`.

### Port Forwarding <a id="port-forwarding"></a>

In many scenarios you will run into software that listens to specific ports in the machine. When this happens in your local machine you can type `localhost:PORT` or `127.0.0.1:PORT`, but what do you do with a remote server that does not have its ports directly available through the network/internet?.

This is called _port forwarding_ and it comes in two flavors: Local Port Forwarding and Remote Port Forwarding \(see the pictures for more details, credit of the pictures from [this StackOverflow post](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/115897/whats-ssh-port-forwarding-and-whats-the-difference-between-ssh-local-and-remot)\).

The most common scenario is local port forwarding, where a service in the remote machine listens in a port and you want to link a port in your local machine to forward to the remote port. For example, if we execute `jupyter notebook` in the remote server that listens to the port `8888`. Thus, to forward that to the local port `9999`, we would do `ssh -L 9999:localhost:8888 foobar@remote_server` and then navigate to `locahost:9999` in our local machine.

### SSH Configuration <a id="ssh-configuration"></a>

We have covered many many arguments that we can pass. A tempting alternative is to create shell aliases that look like

```text
alias my_server="ssh -i ~/.id_ed25519 --port 2222 -L 9999:localhost:8888 foobar@remote_server
```

However, there is a better alternative using `~/.ssh/config`.

```text
Host vm
    User foobar
    HostName 172.16.174.141
    Port 2222
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
    LocalForward 9999 localhost:8888

# Configs can also take wildcards
Host *.mit.edu
    User foobaz
```

An additional advantage of using the `~/.ssh/config` file over aliases is that other programs like `scp`, `rsync`, `mosh`, &c are able to read it as well and convert the settings into the corresponding flags.

Note that the `~/.ssh/config` file can be considered a dotfile, and in general it is fine for it to be included with the rest of your dotfiles. However, if you make it public, think about the information that you are potentially providing strangers on the internet: addresses of your servers, users, open ports, &c. This may facilitate some types of attacks so be thoughtful about sharing your SSH configuration.

Server side configuration is usually specified in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`. Here you can make changes like disabling password authentication, changing ssh ports, enabling X11 forwarding, &c. You can specify config settings on a per user basis.  


### Miscellaneous <a id="miscellaneous"></a>

A common pain when connecting to a remote server are disconnections due to shutting down/sleeping your computer or changing a network. Moreover if one has a connection with significant lag using ssh can become quite frustrating. [Mosh](https://mosh.org/), the mobile shell, improves upon ssh, allowing roaming connections, intermittent connectivity and providing intelligent local echo.

Sometimes it is convenient to mount a remote folder. [sshfs](https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs) can mount a folder on a remote server locally, and then you can use a local editor.

## Shells & Frameworks <a id="shells--frameworks"></a>

During shell tool and scripting we covered the `bash` shell because it is by far the most ubiquitous shell and most systems have it as the default option. Nevertheless, it is not the only option.

For example, the `zsh` shell is a superset of `bash` and provides many convenient features out of the box such as:

* Smarter globbing, `**`
* Inline globbing/wildcard expansion
* Spelling correction
* Better tab completion/selection
* Path expansion \(`cd /u/lo/b` will expand as `/usr/local/bin`\)

**Frameworks** can improve your shell as well. Some popular general frameworks are [prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto) or [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/), and smaller ones that focus on specific features such as [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) or [zsh-history-substring-search](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search). Shells like [fish](https://fishshell.com/) include many of these user-friendly features by default. Some of these features include:

* Right prompt
* Command syntax highlighting
* History substring search
* manpage based flag completions
* Smarter autocompletion
* Prompt themes

One thing to note when using these frameworks is that they may slow down your shell, especially if the code they run is not properly optimized or it is too much code. You can always profile it and disable the features that you do not use often or value over speed.



## Terminal Emulators <a id="terminal-emulators"></a>

Along with customizing your shell, it is worth spending some time figuring out your choice of **terminal emulator** and its settings. There are many many terminal emulators out there \(here is a [comparison](https://anarc.at/blog/2018-04-12-terminal-emulators-1/)\).

Since you might be spending hundreds to thousands of hours in your terminal it pays off to look into its settings. Some of the aspects that you may want to modify in your terminal include:

* Font choice
* Color Scheme
* Keyboard shortcuts
* Tab/Pane support
* Scrollback configuration
* Performance \(some newer terminals like [Alacritty](https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty) or [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) offer GPU acceleration\).
