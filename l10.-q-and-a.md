# L10. Q&A

## Operating Systems 

Some good resources to learn about this topic:

* [MIT’s 6.828 class](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/) - Graduate level class on Operating System Engineering. Class materials are publicly available.
* Modern Operating Systems \(4th ed\) - by Andrew S. Tanenbaum is a good overview of many of the mentioned concepts.
* The Design and Implementation of the FreeBSD Operating System - A good resource about the FreeBSD OS \(note that this is not Linux\).
* Other guides like [Writing an OS in Rust](https://os.phil-opp.com/) where people implement a kernel step by step in various languages, mostly for teaching purposes.

## the tools you’d prioritize learning first

Some topics worth prioritizing:

* Learning how to use your **keyboard** more and your mouse less. This can be through keyboard shortcuts, changing interfaces, &c.
* **text editor.** As a programmer most of your time is spent editing files so it really pays off to learn this skill well.
* how to **automate and/or simplify repetitive tasks** in your workflow because the time savings will be enormous…
* **version control** tools like Git and how to use it in conjunction with GitHub to collaborate in modern software projects.

### When do I use Python versus a Bash scripts versus some other language <a id="when-do-i-use-python-versus-a-bash-scripts-versus-some-other-language"></a>

bash scripts are useful for short and simple one-off scripts when you just want to run a specific series of commands. bash has a set of oddities that make it hard to work with for larger programs or scripts:

* bash is easy to get right for a simple use case but it can be really hard to get right for all possible inputs. For example, spaces in script arguments have led to countless bugs in bash scripts.
* bash is not amenable to code reuse so it can be hard to reuse components of previous programs you have written. More generally, there is no concept of software libraries in bash.
* bash relies on many magic strings like `$?` or `$@` to refer to specific values, whereas other languages refer to them explicitly, like `exitCode` or `sys.args` respectively.

Therefore, for larger and/or more complex scripts we recommend using more mature scripting languages like Python or Ruby. You can find online countless libraries that people have already written to solve common problems in these languages. If you find a library that implements the specific functionality you care about in some language, usually the best thing to do is to just use that language.



## difference between `source script.sh` and `./script.sh`

In both cases the `script.sh` will be read and executed in a bash session, 

the difference lies in which session is running the commands.

* `source:` the commands are **executed in your current bash session** and thus any changes made to the current environment, like changing directories or defining functions will persist in the current session once the `source` command finishes executing.
* `./script.sh`, your current bash session **starts a new instance of bash that will run the commands in `script.sh`**. Thus, if `script.sh` changes directories, the new bash instance will change directories but once it exits and returns control to the parent bash session, the parent session will remain in the same place. 
*  if `script.sh` defines **a function that you want to access in your terminal**, you need to `source` it for it to be defined in your current bash session. Otherwise, if you run it, the new bash process will be the one to process the function definition instead of your current shell.

## the places where various packages and tools are stored and how does referencing them work? What even is `/bin` or `/lib`?

they are all found in the directories listed in your `PATH` environment variable and you can use the `which` command \(or the `type` command\) to check where your shell is finding a specific program. 

check the [Filesystem, Hierarchy Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard) for a more comprehensive list.

* `/bin` - Essential command binaries
* `/sbin` - Essential system binaries, usually to be run by root
* `/dev` - Device files, special files that often are interfaces to hardware devices
* `/etc` - Host-specific system-wide configuration files
* `/home` - Home directories for users in the system
* `/lib` - Common libraries for system programs
* `/opt` - Optional application software
* `/sys` - Contains information and configuration for the system \(covered in the [first lecture](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/course-shell/)\)
* `/tmp` - Temporary files \(also `/var/tmp`\). Usually deleted between reboots.
* `/usr/` - Read only user data
  * `/usr/bin` - Non-essential command binaries
  * `/usr/sbin` - Non-essential system binaries, usually to be run by root
  * `/usr/local/bin` - Binaries for user compiled programs
* `/var` - Variable files like logs or caches

## `apt-get install` a python-whatever, or `pip install` whatever package?

It’s related to whether you should use your system’s package manager or a language-specific package manager to install software.

* less popular ones or more recent ones might not be available in your system package manager. In this case, using the language-specific tool is the better choice.
* language-specific package managers usually have more up to date versions of packages than system package managers.
* system package manager, libraries will be installed system wide. This means that if you need different versions of a library for development purposes, the system package manager might not suffice. For this scenario, most programming languages provide some sort of isolated or virtual environment so you can install different versions of libraries without running into conflicts. For Python, there’s virtualenv, and for Ruby, there’s RVM.
* Depending on the operating system and the hardware architecture, some of these packages might come with binaries or might need to be compiled. For instance, in ARM computers like the Raspberry Pi, using the system package manager can be better than the language specific one if the former comes in form of binaries and the latter needs to be compiled. This is highly dependent on your specific setup.

You should try to use one solution or the other and not both since that can lead to conflicts that are hard to debug. 

to use the language-specific package manager whenever possible, and to use isolated environments \(like Python’s virtualenv\) to avoid polluting the global environment.



## the easiest and best profiling tools to use to improve performance of my code

*  [print timing](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/debugging-profiling/#timing). You just manually compute the time taken between different parts of your code. By repeatedly doing this, you can effectively do a binary search over your code and find the segment of code that took the longest.
* Valgrind’s [Callgrind](http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/cl-manual.html) lets you run your program and measure how long everything takes and all the call stacks, namely which function called which other function. It then produces an annotated version of your program’s source code with the time taken per line. However, it slows down your program by an order of magnitude and does not support threads. 
* the [`perf`](http://www.brendangregg.com/perf.html) tool and other language specific sampling profilers can output useful data pretty quickly.
*  [Flamegraphs](http://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html) are a good visualization tool for the output of said sampling profilers. 
* for web development, the dev tools built into Chrome and Firefox have fantastic profilers.
* Sometimes the slow part of your code will be because your system is waiting for an event like a disk read or a network packet. In those cases, it is worth checking that back-of-the-envelope calculations about the theoretical speed in terms of hardware capabilities do not deviate from the actual readings.
* There are also specialized tools to analyze the wait times in system calls. These include tools like [eBPF](http://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2019-01-01/learn-ebpf-tracing.html) that perform kernel tracing of user programs. In particular [`bpftrace`](https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace) is worth checking out if you need to perform this sort of low level profiling.

## browser plugins

mostly related to security and usability:

* [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) - It is a [wide-spectrum](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Blocking-mode) blocker that doesn’t just stop ads, but all sorts of third-party communication a page may try to do. This also covers inline scripts and other types of resource loading. If you’re willing to spend some time on configuration to make things work, go to [medium mode](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Blocking-mode:-medium-mode) or even [hard mode](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Blocking-mode:-hard-mode). Those will make some sites not work until you’ve fiddled with the settings enough, but will also significantly improve your online security. Otherwise, the [easy mode](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Blocking-mode:-easy-mode) is already a good default that blocks most ads and tracking. You can also define your own rules about what website objects to block.
* [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/) - a fork of Stylish \(don’t use Stylish, it was shown to [steal users’ browsing history](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/07/05/browsers_pull_stylish_but_invasive_browser_extension/)\), allows you to sideload custom CSS stylesheets to websites. With Stylus you can easily customize and modify the appearance of websites. This can be removing a sidebar, changing the background color or even the text size or font choice. This is fantastic for making websites that you visit frequently more readable. Moreover, Stylus can find styles written by other users and published in [userstyles.org](https://userstyles.org/). Most common websites have one or several dark theme stylesheets for instance.
* Full Page Screen Capture - [Built into Firefox](https://screenshots.firefox.com/) and [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/full-page-screen-capture/fdpohaocaechififmbbbbbknoalclacl?hl=en). Lets you take a screenshot of a full website, often much better than printing for reference purposes.
* [Multi Account Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/) - lets you separate cookies into “containers”, allowing you to browse the web with different identities and/or ensuring that websites are unable to share information between them.
* Password Manager Integration - Most password managers have browser extensions that make inputting your credentials into websites not only more convenient but also more secure. Compared to simply copy-pasting your user and password, these tools will first check that the website domain matches the one listed for the entry, preventing phishing attacks that impersonate popular websites to steal credentials.
