### Keyboard remapping <a id="keyboard-remapping"></a>

* Remap Caps Lock to Ctrl or Escape. We \(the instructors\) highly encourage this setting since Caps Lock has a very convenient location but is rarely used.
* Remapping PrtSc to Play/Pause music. Most OSes have a play/pause key.
* Swapping Ctrl and the Meta \(Windows or Command\) key.



* Open a new terminal or browser window.
* Inserting some specific text, e.g. your long email address or your MIT ID number.
* Sleeping the computer or the displays.

There are even more complex modifications you can configure:

* Remapping sequences of keys, e.g. pressing shift five times toggles Caps Lock.
* Remapping on tap vs on hold, e.g. Caps Lock key is remapped to Esc if you quickly tap it, but is remapped to Ctrl if you hold it and use it as a modifier.
* Having remaps being keyboard or software specific.

Some software resources to get started on the topic:

* macOS - [karabiner-elements](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/), [skhd](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd) or [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai/)
* Linux - [xmodmap](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xmodmap) or [Autokey](https://github.com/autokey/autokey)
* Windows - Builtin in Control Panel, [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) or [SharpKeys](https://www.randyrants.com/category/sharpkeys/)
* QMK - If your keyboard supports custom firmware you can use [QMK](https://docs.qmk.fm/) to configure the hardware device itself so the remaps works for any machine you use the keyboard with.
