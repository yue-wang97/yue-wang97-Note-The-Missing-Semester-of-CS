## Keyboard remapping

* Remap Caps Lock to Ctrl or Escape. We \(the instructors\) highly encourage this setting since Caps Lock has a very convenient location but is rarely used.
* Remapping PrtSc to Play/Pause music. Most OSes have a play/pause key.
* Swapping Ctrl and the Meta \(Windows or Command\) key.



* Open a new terminal or browser window.
* Inserting some specific text, e.g. your long email address or your MIT ID number.
* Sleeping the computer or the displays.

There are even more complex modifications you can configure:

* Remapping sequences of keys, e.g. pressing shift five times toggles Caps Lock.
* Remapping on tap vs on hold, e.g. Caps Lock key is remapped to Esc if you quickly tap it, but is remapped to Ctrl if you hold it and use it as a modifier.
* Having remaps being keyboard or software specific.

Some software resources to get started on the topic:

* macOS - [karabiner-elements](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/), [skhd](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd) or [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai/)
* Linux - [xmodmap](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xmodmap) or [Autokey](https://github.com/autokey/autokey)
* Windows - Builtin in Control Panel, [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) or [SharpKeys](https://www.randyrants.com/category/sharpkeys/)
* QMK - If your keyboard supports custom firmware you can use [QMK](https://docs.qmk.fm/) to configure the hardware device itself so the remaps works for any machine you use the keyboard with.

## Daemons

Most computers have a series of processes that are always running in the background rather than waiting for a user to launch them and interact with them.

These processes are called daemons and the programs that run as daemons often end with a `d` to indicate so. 

### sshd

For example `sshd`, the SSH daemon, is the program responsible for listening to incoming SSH requests and checking that the remote user has the necessary credentials to log in.

### Systemd

In Linux, `systemd` \(the system daemon\) is the most common solution for running and setting up daemon processes.   
You can run `systemctl status` to list the current running daemons. Most of them might sound unfamiliar but are responsible for core parts of the system such as managing the network, solving DNS queries or displaying the graphical interface for the system.   
Systemd can be interacted with the `systemctl` command in order to `enable`, `disable`, `start`, `stop`, `restart` or check the `status` of services \(those are the `systemctl` commands\).

More interestingly, `systemd` has a fairly accessible interface for configuring and enabling new daemons \(or services\). Below is an example of a daemon for running a simple Python app. 

```text
# /etc/systemd/system/myapp.service
[Unit]
Description=My Custom App
After=network.target

[Service]
User=foo
Group=foo
WorkingDirectory=/home/foo/projects/mydaemon
ExecStart=/usr/bin/local/python3.7 app.py
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

### cron

Also, if you just want to run some program with a given frequency there is no need to build a custom daemon, you can use [`cron`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/cron.8.html), a daemon your system already runs to perform scheduled tasks.

## FUSE

[FUSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace) \(Filesystem in User Space\) allows filesystems to be implemented by a user program. FUSE lets users run user space code for filesystem calls and then bridges the necessary calls to the kernel interfaces. In practice, this means that users can implement arbitrary functionality for filesystem calls.



Some interesting examples of FUSE filesystems are:

* [sshfs](https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs) - Open locally remote files/folder through an SSH connection.
* [rclone](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/) - Mount cloud storage services like Dropbox, GDrive, Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage and open data locally.
* [gocryptfs](https://nuetzlich.net/gocryptfs/) - Encrypted overlay system. Files are stored encrypted but once the FS is mounted they appear as plaintext in the mountpoint.
* [kbfs](https://keybase.io/docs/kbfs) - Distributed filesystem with end-to-end encryption. You can have private, shared and public folders.
* [borgbackup](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage/mount.html) - Mount your deduplicated, compressed and encrypted backups for ease of browsing.

## Backups

There are two types of people:

* Those who do backups
* Those who will do backups

Any data you own that you haven’t backed up is data that could be gone at any moment, forever.

having an off-site backup is a recommended practice.

Synchronization solutions are not backups. Dropbox/GDrive, disk mirroring solutions like RAID are not backups. 

### 3-2-1 Rule

The [3-2-1 rule](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/data_backup_options.pdf) is a general recommended strategy for backing up your data. It state that you should have:

* at least **3 copies** of your data
* **2** copies in **different mediums**
* **1** of the copies being **offsite**

### Testing your backups <a id="testing-your-backups"></a>

A common pitfall when performing backups is blindly trusting whatever the system says it’s doing and not verifying that the data can be properly recovered. Toy Story 2 was almost lost and their backups were not working, [luck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dhp_20j0Ys) ended up saving them.

### Versioning <a id="versioning"></a>

You should understand that [RAID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID) is not a backup, and in general **mirroring is not a backup solution**. Simply syncing your files somewhere will not help in several scenarios, such as:

* Data corruption
* Malicious software
* Deleting files by mistake

A proper backup system should be versioned in order to prevent this failure mode. By providing different snapshots in time one can easily navigate them to restore whatever was lost. The most widely known software of this kind is **macOS Time Machine**.



### Deduplication <a id="deduplication"></a>

[data deduplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_deduplication) comes into play, by keeping track of what has already been stored one can do **incremental backups** where only the changes from one version to the next need to be stored. This significantly reduces the amount of space needed for backups beyond the first copy.

### Encryption

many backup solutions offer **client side encryption** where data is encrypted before being sent to the server. That way the server cannot read the data it is storing but you can decrypt it with your secret key.

As a side note, if your disk \(or home partition\) is not encrypted, then anyone that get hold of your computer can manage to override the user access controls and read your data. Modern hardware supports fast and efficient read and writes of encrypted data so you might want to consider enabling **full disk encryption**.

### Append only

Namely, say someone hacks into your system, are they able to wipe all your copies of the data you care about? If you worry about that scenario then you need some sort of append only backup solution. 

In general, this means **having a server that will allow you to send new data but will refuse to delete existing data.** Usually users have two keys, an append only key that supports creating new backups and a full access key that also allows for deleting old backups that are no longer needed. The latter one is stored offline.

Note that this is a quite challenging scenario since you need the ability to make changes whilst still preventing a malicious user from deleting your data. Existing commercial solutions include [Tarsnap](https://www.tarsnap.com/) and [Borgbase](https://www.borgbase.com/).

### Additional considerations <a id="additional-considerations"></a>

Some other things you may want to look into are:

* **Periodic backups**: outdated backups can become pretty useless. Making backups regularly should be a consideration for your system
* **Bootable backups**: some programs allow you to clone your entire disk. That way you have an image that contains an entire copy of your system you can boot directly from.
* **Differential backup strategies**, you may not necessarily care the same about all your data. You can define different backup policies for different types of data.
* **Append only backups** an additional consideration is to enforce append only operations to your backup repositories in order to prevent malicious agents to delete them if they get hold of your machine.

### hardlink

One way to efficiently implement deduplication is to use hardlinks. Whereas symbolic link \(also called a soft link or a symlink\) is a file that points to another file or folder, a hardlink is a exact copy of the pointer \(it uses the same inode and points to the same place in the disk\). Thus if the original file is removed a symlink stops working whereas a hard link doesn’t. However, hardlinks only work for files. Try using the command `ln` to create hard links and compare them to symlinks created with `ln -s`. \(In macOS you will need to install the gnu coreutils or the hln package\).

### Webservices <a id="webservices"></a>

Not all the data that you use lives on your hard disk. If you use **webservices**, then it might be the case that some data you care about, such as Google Docs presentations or Spotify playlists, is stored online. Another easy example that is easy to forget is email accounts with web access, such as Gmail. Figuring out a backup solution in these cases is somewhat trickier. However, there are many services that allow you to download your data, either directly or via an API. Tools such as [gmvault](https://github.com/gaubert/gmvault) for Gmail are available to download the email files to your computer.

### Webpages <a id="webpages"></a>

Similarly, some high quality content can be found online in the form of webpages. If said content is static one can easily back it up by just saving the website and all of its attachments. Another alternative is the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/), a massive digital archive of the World Wide Web managed by the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/), a non profit organization focused on the preservation of all sorts of media. The Wayback Machine allows you to capture and archive webpages being able to later retrieve all the snapshots that have been archived for that website. If you find it useful, consider [donating](https://archive.org/donate/) to the project.

### Resources <a id="resources"></a>

Some good backup programs and services we have used and can honestly recommend:

* [Tarsnap](https://www.tarsnap.com/) - deduplicated, encrypted online backup service for the truly paranoid.
* [Borg Backup](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/) - deduplicated backup program that supports compression and authenticated encryption. If you need a cloud provider [rsync.net](https://www.rsync.net/products/borg.html) has special offerings for Borg users.
* [rsync](https://rsync.samba.org/) is a utility that provides fast incremental file transfer. It is not a full backup solution.
* [rclone](https://rclone.org/) like rsync but for cloud storage providers such as Amazon S3, Dropbox, Google Drive, rsync.net, &c. Supports client side encryption of remote folders.

## APIs

### curl, jq

Most of these APIs have a similar format. They are structured URLs, often rooted at `api.service.com`, where the path and query parameters indicate what data you want to read or what action you want to perform. For the US weather data for example, to get the forecast for a particular location, you issue GET request \(with **`curl`** for example\) to https://api.weather.gov/points/42.3604,-71.094. The response itself contains a bunch of other URLs that let you get specific forecasts for that region. Usually, the responses are formatted as JSON, which you can then pipe through a tool like [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) to massage into what you care about.

### OAuth

Some APIs require **authentication**, and this usually takes the form of some sort of secret _token_ that you need to include with the request. You should read the documentation for the API to see what the particular service you are looking for uses, but “[OAuth](https://www.oauth.com/)” is a protocol you will often see used. At its heart, OAuth is a way to give you tokens that can “act as you” on a given service, and can only be used for particular purposes. Keep in mind that these tokens are _secret_, and anyone who gains access to your token can do whatever the token allows under _your_ account!

### IFTTT

[IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) is a website and service centered around the idea of APIs — it provides integrations with tons of services, and lets you chain events from them in nearly arbitrary ways. Give it a look!



## Common command-line flags/patterns

Command-line tools vary a lot, and you will often want to check out their **`man`** pages before using them. They often share some common features though that can be good to be aware of:

* Most tools support some kind of **`--help`** flag to display brief usage instructions for the tool.
* Many tools that can cause irrevocable change support the notion of a “dry run” in which they only print what they _would have done_, but do not actually perform the change. Similarly, they often have an “interactive” flag that will prompt you for each destructive action.
* You can usually use **`--version`** or `-V` to have the program print its own version \(handy for reporting bugs!\).
* Almost all tools have a **`--verbose`** or `-v` flag to produce more verbose output. You can usually include the flag multiple times \(`-vvv`\) to get _more_ verbose output, which can be handy for debugging. Similarly, many tools have a **`--quiet`** flag for making it only print something on error.
* In many tools, `-` in place of a file name means “standard input” or “standard output”, depending on the argument.
* Possibly destructive tools are generally not recursive by default, but support a “recursive” flag \(often `-r`\) to make them recurse.
* Sometimes, you want to pass something that _looks_ like a flag as a normal argument. For example, imagine you wanted to remove a file named `-r`. Or you want to run one program “through” another, like `ssh machine foo`, and you want to pass a flag to the “inner” program \(`foo`\). The special argument `--` makes a program _stop_ processing flags and options \(things starting with `-`\) in what follows, letting you pass things that look like flags without them being interpreted as such: `rm -- -r` or `ssh machine --for-ssh -- foo --for-foo`.

## Window managers

Most of you are used to using a “drag and drop” window manager, like what comes with Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu by default. There are windows that just sort of hang there on screen, and you can drag them around, resize them, and have them overlap one another. But these are only one _type_ of window manager, often referred to as a “**floating” window manager**. 

### tiling

There are many others, especially on Linux. A particularly common alternative is a “**tiling**” window manager. In a tiling window manager, windows never overlap, and are instead arranged as tiles on your screen, sort of like panes in **tmux**. With a tiling window manager, the screen is always filled by whatever windows are open, arranged according to some _layout_. If you have just one window, it takes up the full screen. If you then open another, the original window shrinks to make room for it \(often something like 2/3 and 1/3\). If you open a third, the other windows will again shrink to accommodate the new window. Just like with tmux panes, you can navigate around these tiled windows with your keyboard, and you can resize them and move them around, all without touching the mouse. They are worth looking into!  


### VPNs <a id="vpns"></a>

VPNs are all the rage these days, but it’s not clear that’s for [any good reason](https://gist.github.com/joepie91/5a9909939e6ce7d09e29). You should be aware of what a VPN does and does not get you. **A VPN, in the best case, is** _**really**_ **just a way for you to change your internet service provider as far as the internet is concerned.** All your traffic will look like it’s coming from the VPN provider instead of your “real” location, and the network you are connected to will only see encrypted traffic.

While that may seem attractive, keep in mind that when you use a VPN, all you are really doing is shifting your trust from you current ISP to the VPN hosting company. Whatever your ISP _could_ see, the VPN provider now sees _instead_. If you trust them _more_ than your ISP, that is a win, but otherwise, it is not clear that you have gained much. If you are sitting on some dodgy unencrypted public Wi-Fi at an airport, then maybe you don’t trust the connection much, but at home, the trade-off is not quite as clear.

You should also know that these days, much of your traffic, at least of a sensitive nature, is _**already**_ **encrypted through HTTPS or TLS** more generally. In that case, it usually matters little whether you are on a “bad” network or not – the network operator will only learn what servers you talk to, but not anything about the data that is exchanged.

Notice that I said “in the best case” above. It is not unheard of for VPN providers to accidentally misconfigure their software such that the encryption is either weak or entirely disabled. **Some VPN providers are malicious \(or at the very least opportunist\), and will log all your traffic, and possibly sell information about it to third parties.** Choosing a bad VPN provider is often worse than not using one in the first place.

In a pinch, MIT [runs a VPN](https://ist.mit.edu/vpn) for its students, so that may be worth taking a look at. Also, if you’re going to roll your own, give [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) a look.



### Markdown <a id="markdown"></a>

At its core, **Markdown is an attempt to codify the way that people already often mark up text when they are writing plain text documents.**

**-**Emphasis \(_italics_\) is added by surrounding a word with `*`.   
-Strong emphasis \(**bold**\) is added using `**`.   
-Lines starting with `#` are headings \(and the number of `#`s is the subheading level\).   
-Any line starting with `- [space]` is a bullet list item,   
-any line starting with a number + `. (like 1.)` is a numbered list item.   
-Backtick\(\`\) is used to show words in `code font`, and a code block can be entered by indenting a line with four spaces or surrounding it with triple-backticks:

```text
```(language)
code goes here
```
```

-To add a link, place the _text_ for the link in square brackets, and the URL immediately following that in parentheses: `[name](url)`. 

Markdown is easy to get started with, and you can use it nearly everywhere. In fact, the lecture notes for this lecture, and all the others, are written in Markdown, and you can see the raw Markdown [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/missing-semester/missing-semester/master/_2020/potpourri.md).



## Hammerspoon \(desktop automation on macOS\)

[Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org/) is a desktop automation framework for macOS. It lets you write Lua scripts that hook into operating system functionality, allowing you to interact with the keyboard/mouse, windows, displays, filesystem, and much more.

Some examples of things you can do with Hammerspoon:

* Bind hotkeys to move windows to specific locations
* Create a menu bar button that automatically lays out windows in a specific layout
* Mute your speaker when you arrive in lab \(by detecting the WiFi network\)
* Show you a warning if you’ve accidentally taken your friend’s power supply

At a high level, Hammerspoon lets you run arbitrary Lua code, bound to menu buttons, key presses, or events, and Hammerspoon provides an extensive library for interacting with the system, so there’s basically no limit to what you can do with it. Many people have made their Hammerspoon configurations public, so you can generally find what you need by searching the internet, but you can always write your own code from scratch.

### Resources

* [Getting Started with Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org/go/)
* [Sample configurations](https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon/wiki/Sample-Configurations)
* [Anish’s Hammerspoon config](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotfiles-local/tree/mac/hammerspoon)

## Booting + Live USBs

When your machine boots up, before the operating system is loaded, the [BIOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS)/[UEFI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface) initializes the system. During this process, you can press a specific key combination to configure this layer of software. For example, your computer may say something like “Press F9 to configure BIOS. Press F12 to enter boot menu.” during the boot process. You can configure all sorts of hardware-related settings in the BIOS menu. You can also enter the boot menu to boot from an alternate device instead of your hard drive.

[Live USBs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_USB) are USB flash drives containing an operating system. You can create one of these by downloading an operating system \(e.g. a Linux distribution\) and burning it to the flash drive. This process is a little bit more complicated than simply copying a `.iso` file to the disk. There are tools like [UNetbootin](https://unetbootin.github.io/) to help you create live USBs.

Live USBs are useful for all sorts of purposes. Among other things, if you break your existing operating system installation so that it no longer boots, you can use a live USB to recover data or fix the operating system.  


## Virtual machines & environment

[Virtual machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine) and similar tools like containers let you emulate a whole computer system, including the operating system. This can be useful for creating an isolated environment for testing, development, or exploration \(e.g. running potentially malicious code\).

### Docker, Vagrant, **python virtual environment**

[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) is a tool that lets you describe machine configurations \(operating system, services, packages, etc.\) in code, and then instantiate VMs with a simple `vagrant up`. 

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is conceptually similar but it uses containers instead.

 **python virtual environment** [https://python.land/virtual-environments/virtualenv](https://python.land/virtual-environments/virtualenv)

### Cloud

You can also rent virtual machines on the cloud, and it’s a nice way to get instant access to:

* A cheap always-on machine that has a public IP address, used to host services
* A machine with a lot of CPU, disk, RAM, and/or GPU
* Many more machines than you physically have access to \(billing is often by the second, so if you want a lot of computing for a short amount of time, it’s feasible to rent 1000 computers for a couple of minutes\)

Popular services include [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/),[ Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/), [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/).

If you’re a member of MIT CSAIL, you can get free VMs for research purposes through the [CSAIL OpenStack instance](https://tig.csail.mit.edu/shared-computing/open-stack/).

## Notebook programming

[Notebook programming environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notebook_interface) can be really handy for doing certain types of interactive or exploratory development. Perhaps the most popular notebook programming environment today is [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), for Python \(and several other languages\). [Wolfram Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) is another notebook programming environment that’s great for doing math-oriented programming.

## GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is one of the most popular platforms for open-source software development. Many of the tools we’ve talked about in this class, from [vim](https://github.com/vim/vim) to [Hammerspoon](https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon), are hosted on GitHub. It’s easy to get started contributing to open-source to help improve the tools that you use every day.

There are two primary ways in which people contribute to projects on GitHub:

* Creating an [issue](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue). This can be used to report bugs or request a new feature. Neither of these involves reading or writing code, so it can be pretty lightweight to do. High-quality bug reports can be extremely valuable to developers. Commenting on existing discussions can be helpful too.
* Contribute code through a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests). This is generally more involved than creating an issue. You can [fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) a repository on GitHub, clone your fork, create a new branch, make some changes \(e.g. fix a bug or implement a feature\), push the branch, and then [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request). After this, there will generally be some back-and-forth with the project maintainers, who will give you feedback on your patch. Finally, if all goes well, your patch will be merged into the upstream repository. Often times, larger projects will have a contributing guide, tag beginner-friendly issues, and some even have mentorship programs to help first-time contributors become familiar with the project.
