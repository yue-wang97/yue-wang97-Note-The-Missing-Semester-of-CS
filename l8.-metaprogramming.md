## Build systems <a id="build-systems"></a>

### make

`make` is one of the most common build systems out there. It has its warts, but works quite well for simple-to-moderate projects. When you run `make`, it consults a file called `Makefile` in the current directory. All the targets, their dependencies, and the rules are defined in that file. Let’s take a look at one:

Makefile:

```text
paper.pdf: paper.tex plot-data.png
	pdflatex paper.tex

plot-%.png: %.dat plot.py
	./plot.py -i $*.dat -o $@
```

The `%` in a rule is a “pattern”, and will match the same string on the left and on the right. For example, if the target `plot-foo.png` is requested, `make` will look for the dependencies `foo.dat` and `plot.py`. Now let’s look at what happens if we run `make` with an empty source directory.

```text
$ make
make: *** No rule to make target 'paper.tex', needed by 'paper.pdf'.  Stop.
```

`make` is helpfully telling us that in order to build `paper.pdf`, it needs `paper.tex`, and it has no rule telling it how to make that file. Let’s try making it!

```text
$ touch paper.tex
$ make
make: *** No rule to make target 'plot-data.png', needed by 'paper.pdf'.  Stop.
```

Hmm, interesting, there _is_ a rule to make `plot-data.png`, but it is a pattern rule. Since the source files do not exist \(`data.dat`\), `make` simply states that it cannot make that file. Let’s try creating all the files:

```text
$ cat paper.tex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\begin{document}
\includegraphics[scale=0.65]{plot-data.png}
\end{document}
$ cat plot.py
#!/usr/bin/env python
import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import argparse

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument('-i', type=argparse.FileType('r'))
parser.add_argument('-o')
args = parser.parse_args()

data = np.loadtxt(args.i)
plt.plot(data[:, 0], data[:, 1])
plt.savefig(args.o)
$ cat data.dat
1 1
2 2
3 3
4 4
5 8
```

Now what happens if we run `make`?

```text
$ make
./plot.py -i data.dat -o plot-data.png
pdflatex paper.tex
... lots of output ...
```

And look, it made a PDF for us! What if we run `make` again?

```text
$ make
make: 'paper.pdf' is up to date.
```

It didn’t do anything! Why not? Well, because it didn’t need to. It checked that all of the previously-built targets were still up to date with respect to their listed dependencies. We can test this by modifying `paper.tex` and then re-running `make`:

```text
$ vim paper.tex
$ make
pdflatex paper.tex
...
```

Notice that `make` did _not_ re-run `plot.py` because that was not necessary; none of `plot-data.png`’s dependencies changed!

## Dependency management <a id="dependency-management"></a>

At a more macro level, your software projects are likely to have dependencies that are themselves projects. You might depend on installed programs \(like `python`\), system packages \(like `openssl`\), or libraries within your programming language \(like `matplotlib`\). These days, most dependencies will be available through a _repository_ that hosts a large number of such dependencies in a single place, and provides a convenient mechanism for installing them. Some examples include the Ubuntu package repositories for Ubuntu system packages, which you access through the `apt` tool, RubyGems for Ruby libraries, PyPi for Python libraries, or the Arch User Repository for Arch Linux user-contributed packages.

### _versioning_

 The first among these is _versioning_. Most projects that other projects depend on issue a _version number_ with every release. Usually something like 8.1.3 or 64.1.20192004. They are often, but not always, numerical. Version numbers serve many purposes, and one of the most important of them is to ensure that software keeps working. Imagine, for example, that I release a new version of my library where I have renamed a particular function. If someone tried to build some software that depends on my library after I release that update, the build might fail because it calls a function that no longer exists! Versioning attempts to solve this problem by letting a project say that it depends on a particular version, or range of versions, of some other project. That way, even if the underlying library changes, dependent software continues building by using an older version of my library.



The exact meaning of each one varies between projects, but one relatively common standard is [_semantic versioning_](https://semver.org/). With semantic versioning, every version number is of the form: major.minor.patch. The rules are:

* If a new release does not change the API, increase the patch version.
* If you _add_ to your API in a backwards-compatible way, increase the minor version and change the patch number to 0.
* If you change the API in a non-backwards-compatible way, increase the major version.
