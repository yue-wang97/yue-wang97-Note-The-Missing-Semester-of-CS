# L7. Debugging and Profiling

### Printf debugging and Logging <a id="printf-debugging-and-logging"></a>

Logging is better than regular print statements for several reasons:

* You can log to files, sockets or even remote servers instead of standard output.
* Logging supports severity levels \(such as INFO, DEBUG, WARN, ERROR, &c\), that allow you to filter the output accordingly.
* For new issues, there’s a fair chance that your logs will contain enough information to detect what is going wrong.



[Here](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/static/files/logger.py) is an example code that logs messages:

```bash
$ python logger.py
# Raw output as with just prints
$ python logger.py log
# Log formatted output
$ python logger.py log ERROR
# Print only ERROR levels and above
$ python logger.py color
# Color formatted output
```

#### color code them

how does it do it? Programs like `ls` or `grep` are using [ANSI escape codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code), which are special sequences of characters to indicate your shell to change the color of the output. 

For example, executing `echo -e "\e[38;2;255;0;0mThis is red\e[0m"` prints the message `This is red` in red on your terminal, as long as it supports [true color](https://gist.github.com/XVilka/8346728#terminals--true-color). If your terminal doesn’t support this \(e.g. macOS’s Terminal.app\), you can use the more universally supported escape codes for 16 color choices, for example `echo -e "\e[31;1mThis is red\e[0m"`.



### Third party logs <a id="third-party-logs"></a>

on macOS there is still `/var/log/system.log` but an increasing number of tools use the system log, that can be displayed with [`log show`](https://www.manpagez.com/man/1/log/). 

You can use data wrangling in "-log show"

For logging under the system logs you can use the [`logger`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/logger.1.html) shell program. 

Here’s an example of using `logger` and how to check that the entry made it to the system logs. Moreover, most programming languages have bindings logging to the system log.

```text
logger "Hello Logs"
# On macOS
log show --last 1m | grep Hello
# On Linux
journalctl --since "1m ago" | grep Hello
```
